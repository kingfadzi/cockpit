# Key Questions for ARB Domain Experts

This document outlines the critical, application-centric questions that a domain expert (from Security, Data, Operations, or Enterprise Architecture) needs answered when they visit the ARB Dashboard. The dashboard's primary goal is to surface the data required to answer these questions quickly and efficiently.

### Foundational Questions for Any ARB Domain Expert

These are the high-level questions that the dashboard should answer immediately upon loading.

#### Immediate Priorities
1.  Which applications pose the highest risk to my domain *right now*?
2.  How many critical risks do I need to deal with across the entire application portfolio?
3.  What is the total number of open, unresolved items that my team needs to address?

#### Workload and Triage
4.  Which applications have the most open risk items?
5.  How many new risks have appeared recently (in the last week vs. the last month)?
6.  What is the breakdown of risks by status? (e.g., How many are brand new and pending review vs. already being worked on?)

#### Performance and Progress
7.  How effective have we been at resolving risks recently? Is our resolution rate keeping up with the rate of new risks?
8.  What is the overall health score (Average Priority Score) for my domain? Is it getting better or worse?

### Domain-Specific Question Examples

Here is how the foundational questions translate to the specific concerns of each domain expert.

#### 1. For a Security Expert (Security ARB)
-   Which applications have the most severe security vulnerabilities (highest priority score)?
-   Are there any applications with a large number of unresolved security findings?
-   Which applications are failing to provide required security evidence, leading to new risks?
-   How many critical security risks are pending our review?

#### 2. For a Data Governance Expert (Data ARB)
-   Which applications present the biggest data integrity or confidentiality risks?
-   Are there systemic data handling issues showing up in multiple applications?
-   Which applications have the highest number of open items related to data classification or privacy?

#### 3. For an Operations & Resilience Expert (Operations ARB)
-   Which applications are most at risk of availability or resilience failures?
-   What is the trend of operational risks? Are we seeing more issues related to downtime, disaster recovery, or scalability?
-   Which critical applications have the most unresolved operational risks?

#### 4. For an Enterprise Architect (Enterprise Architecture ARB)
-   Which applications are deviating most from our mandated architectural standards?
-   Are we seeing a pattern of governance risks (e.g., use of unapproved technology, lack of design documentation) in specific applications?
-   Which applications have the highest "architectural debt" as represented by their risk score?
